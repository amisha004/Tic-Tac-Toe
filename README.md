# Tic-Tac-Toe

* Tic-tac-toe is a two-player paper-and-pencil game in which each player alternates marking spaces in a three-by-three grid with an X or an O. 
* However, by playing this amazing game electronically using this code, we are not wasting paper or, to put it another way, we are conserving trees. 
* The winner is the player who successfully places three of their markers in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. It's a solved game with a forced draw if both players play their best.
